# To-Do List Application in Rust

This is a simple to-do list application written in Rust. It allows you to add, remove, and list tasks in different ways.

Every task has a title, a description, a due date, a topic, a done flag, and a priority level.

You can use `help` to see all commands and `help <command>` to see more details about a specific command.

## Requirements

- Rust 1.x or higher
- A terminal or command prompt to run the application
